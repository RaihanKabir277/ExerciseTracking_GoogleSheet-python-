# 🏋️ Exercise Tracking with Python, Nutritionix, and Sheety

This project demonstrates how to build a **Python-based exercise tracking system** that integrates two external APIs:

1. **[Nutritionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/)** – Natural language processing for exercise data (e.g., “I ran 5 km” → duration, calories burned).  
2. **[Sheety API](https://sheety.co/)** – Transform Google Sheets into a REST API for persistent storage and visualization.  

The application applies key concepts of **API consumption**, **authentication methods (Basic & Bearer)**, **environment variable handling**, and **data persistence**, making it a practical case study in applied software engineering and data logging.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Accepts user input in natural language (e.g., "I cycled for 30 minutes").  
- ✅ Queries Nutritionix API to extract structured exercise data (duration, calories).  
- ✅ Logs exercise details into Google Sheets via Sheety API.  
- ✅ Supports **Basic Authentication** and **Bearer Token Authentication**.  
- ✅ Implements **environment variable management** for security.  
- ✅ Provides clean, academic-style code structure with modular design.
